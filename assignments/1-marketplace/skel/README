Homework #1: Marketplace

    The main logic of the homework in contained whithin the Marketplace class,
producer and consumer just iterating through their respective lists and calling
the appropriate methods from Marketplace.
    For registering new producers and assigning new carts to consumers I'm
using a lock for each respective action, in order to make sure each producer_id
and cart_id is unique.
    Every access to a publisher's queue is protected by the lock assigned to
that publisher since we don't want to publish a new product while a consumer
is looking do add or remove a product from the cart. Cart operations don't have
to be syncronized since only the consumer which owns that cart can access it.
    Each cart is a dictionary where the products are the keys and the values
are a list of the producers who have published those products.

Remarks
    Overall the homework was too simple and honestly I don't really see it's
purpose in this course's context. I have to say that I did learn a few new
Python tricks while working on this, but other than that, I feel like the
homework didn't assess any particular skill.
